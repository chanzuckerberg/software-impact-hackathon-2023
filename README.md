# Mapping the Impact of Research Software in Science

The [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/science) hosted a hackathon on **Mapping the Impact of Research Software in Science** (October 24-27, 2023). This repository serves as a project index page to facilitate the discovery and preservation of the output of this event.

## About
Mapping the usage and impact of research software in science remains a challenge due to the lack of canonical data/ infrastructure and inconsistent software citation practices in the scientific literature. The lack of a “software citation graph” means that it’s very hard to answer questions such as: 
- Which software tools are most frequently used by scientists in any given field?
- How does the use of open source compare to proprietary software in any given field?
- Are emerging new tools replacing legacy ones?
- What is the prevalent programming language in any given field?
- Which software tools should be part of a student’s computational curriculum?
- Which software projects should funders prioritize as critical infrastructure for science?
  
In recent years, several attempts have been made to answer these questions by [mining the scientific literature](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/software-mentions), by analyzing electronic notebooks or code repositories. With this event, our goal is to convene practitioners in different areas of computer science / data science / ML, as well as organizations active in this space, to **develop comprehensive datasets, methods, approaches, and resources to map the adoption and impact of research software in science** (specifically scientific open source software).
